<h1>HOT-Philippines Mapping Team Year in Review</h1></center>
  <div class="center">
<p>
  2020 is coming to an end and we are all taking a moment to appreciate on the past twelve months. The HOT-Philippines Mapping Team members are hard at work to provide the best quality of data in our field operations and our mapping and training activities. To help you look back, we prepared a year-end report that summarizes our accomplishment for the year.
</p>
<h3>PhilAWARE Project</h3>
<p>
  HOT-Philippines started the PhilAWARE Project last July 2019 which is a local installation of DisasterAWARE, a disaster risk reduction and integrated early warning and decision support system that also incorporates many data layers form OpenStreetMap.
</p>
<p>
  Part of the activities of the project included remote mapping in the province of Pampanga and Quezon City. Remote mapping and validation activities for both areas have been completed with the help of volunteers, organizations, partners, and other stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from the remote activities, we also began collecting the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PhilAWARE_Data_Model" target="_blank">critical lifeline infrastructure data</a> from the ground in Pampanga. Our field operations was made possible through the support of the local government offices and volunteers in Pampanga despite the restrictions of COVID-19.
</p>
<h3>Mapping in a Pandemic</h3>
<p>
  The pandemic has a large impact on our remote and field operations. Our team has encountered a lot of challenges such as postponing and slowing down of field mapping activities because of sudden lockdowns and surge of active COVID cases, and resigning staff due to COVID-19 safety threat but we were still able to pull them through. <i>[We were also able to make a <a href="https://pistangmapa.github.io/2020/programme/session/pnm200202" target="_blank">documentary</a> on how COVID-19 remapped the reality and presented them during the 2nd day of <a href="https://pistangmapa.github.io/2020/" target="_blank">Pista Ng Mapa</a>. Video available online soon.]</i>
